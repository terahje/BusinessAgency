# BusinessAgency

## Description

This project was for a mock business agency so the site has a sleek design. The subtle animation on the landing page greets the user right away with what this site is offering. This project also showed how to input a video with custom controls, so the time of the video syncs with the red line underneath. The pricing section appears broken on iOS devices, but windows and android appear perfect. This is seemingly due to the swiper.js plugin.
